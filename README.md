## Reflection

This project was built as a place to display my skills and qualifications to employers. This project took me very little time considering it is static and I feel very comfortable with React at this point in my life.

One of the main challenges I ran into was implementing the contact form. I wasn't sure if it would be better to build a small backend server or find a serverless option. I eventually found the EmailJS package which allowed me to keep my site serverless but still receive form information.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. I want to improve on some of the designs in the future and potentially build a backend to handle form submission if traffic becomes too large.
